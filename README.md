# Kids Editor

A simple editor for Kids to start typing without thinking too much with animated fonts instead of simple static ones.

Uses animated typeface from <https://www.behance.net/gallery/47367141/Gotham-Pro-Animated-Typeface-Free>

Thanks to [@fossiloflife](https://twitter.com/fossiloflife) for converting artwork in the gif format.
